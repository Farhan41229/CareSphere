# CareSphere
This is a healthcare management system currently under development (this repository is supposed to streamline our workflow). It aims to provide seamless interaction among doctors, hospitals/clinics, and patients. We intend to write the codes in C++. SQL will be used to maintain a database in the background (currently, we're using file system I/O operations to test our codes). C++ Builder will be used to build the GUI. This started as a project proposal for our OOP-4302 lab.
