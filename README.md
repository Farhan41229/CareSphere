#CareSphere
This is a healthcare management system, currently under development (this repository is supposed to be used to streamline our workflow), which aims to provide a seamless interaction among doctors, hospitals/clinics & patients. We intend to write the codes in C++. SQL will be used to maintain a database in the background. Qt or Cpp Builder will be used to build the GUI. This started as a project proposal for our OOP4302 lab.
